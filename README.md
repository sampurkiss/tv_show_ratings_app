This code scrapes IMDB for TV rating data. Running the app.py module (assuming you have a Dash/Plotly) account creates a chart with a dropdown menu where you can select from a massive list of TV shows.
In order to run the code, you need to first create a data frame using IMDB's list of databases (see here: https://datasets.imdbws.com/).

Once the dataset is compiled, it's trivial to deploy on Heroku.
